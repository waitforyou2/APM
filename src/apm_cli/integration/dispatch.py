"""Primitive dispatch registry.

Maps each APM primitive type to its integrator class and methods.
Both ``install.py`` and ``uninstall/engine.py`` import from this
module so the mapping is defined exactly once.

Skills are marked ``multi_target=True`` because ``SkillIntegrator``
receives all targets at once and routes internally.  All other
primitives are dispatched per-target in the outer loop.
