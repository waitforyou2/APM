"""Target profiles for multi-tool integration.

Each target tool (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, ...) describes where APM
primitives should land.  Adding a new target means adding an entry to
``KNOWN_TARGETS`` -- no new classes required.

Resolver invariant (#820): both :func:`active_targets` and
:func:`active_targets_user_scope` accept ``Union[str, List[str]]`` for
``explicit_target`` but treat the two shapes identically -- string inputs
are wrapped to a one-element list before the resolution loop.  Validity
is enforced *upstream* by
:func:`apm_cli.core.target_detection.parse_target_field`, which is the
shared gatekeeper for both ``--target`` and ``apm.yml``'s ``target:``
field.  Unknown tokens never reach these functions in normal flow; if
one does, it falls through the loop without matching any profile and
the result is an empty list (no silent ``[copilot]`` fallback).
