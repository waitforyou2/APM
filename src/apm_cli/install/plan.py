"""Update plan: structured diff between current lockfile and fresh resolution.

This module is the support library for the ``apm update`` command (#1203).
It also provides the structural-satisfaction check used by
``apm install --frozen``.

Two responsibilities:

1. ``build_update_plan`` -- pure comparison of an old :class:`LockFile`
   against a list of freshly-resolved :class:`DependencyReference`
   objects (post-resolve, pre-download).  Produces an
   :class:`UpdatePlan` of immutable :class:`PlanEntry` records, each
   capturing one dependency's before/after state.

2. ``render_plan_text`` -- ASCII rendering of an :class:`UpdatePlan`
   suitable for terminal display, using the bracket-status convention
   from ``.github/instructions/encoding.instructions.md``.

3. ``lockfile_satisfies_manifest`` -- structural check: does a lockfile
   carry an entry for every direct dependency declared in the manifest?
   Used to enforce ``--frozen`` without running the resolve phase.

Design notes
------------
* No I/O.  No network.  Every function in this module is pure --
  testable in isolation by feeding fixture lockfiles and dep lists.
* Frozen dataclasses (``PlanEntry``, ``UpdatePlan``) so callers can
  freely pass them across phase boundaries without aliasing risk.
* The ``deployed_files`` shown in a plan entry are taken from the
  EXISTING lockfile (i.e. what is currently on disk).  We do not yet
  know the post-update file list at the plan checkpoint, since
  integration has not run.  Showing the "files at risk" surface is
  honest enough for P0; a richer post-download diff is a P1+
  enhancement.
