"""Local-content integration: deploy primitives the user authored locally.

This module handles two related scenarios:

1. **Root project as implicit local package (#714)** -- when the project's own
   ``.apm/`` directory contains skills, instructions, agents, prompts, hooks,
   or commands, ``apm install`` deploys them to target directories exactly like
   dependency primitives.  ``_project_has_root_primitives`` and
   ``_has_local_apm_content`` detect this case.

2. **Local-path dependencies from apm.yml** -- ``_copy_local_package`` copies
   a locally-referenced package into ``apm_modules/`` so the downstream
   integration pipeline can treat it uniformly.

The orchestrator ``_integrate_local_content`` lives in
``apm_cli.install.services`` (the DI seam) and is re-exported from
``apm_cli.commands.install`` for backward-compatible patching. Tests should
patch the symbol at the import path used by the code under test rather than
assuming the implementation lives in the commands module.

Functions
---------
_project_has_root_primitives
    Return True when the project root contains a ``.apm/`` directory.
_has_local_apm_content
    Return True when ``.apm/`` contains at least one primitive file.
_copy_local_package
    Copy a local-path dependency into ``apm_modules/``.

    * Symlink       -> resolve per-file, validate that the resolved target
                       stays within *pkg_root* via ``ensure_path_within``,
                       then ``shutil.copy2`` the resolved content (or recurse
                       for symlinked directories).  A symlink whose resolved

    Each symlink undergoes a per-file resolve -> validate -> copy2 sequence
    rather than a bulk copytree that resolves and copies in separate passes,
    so the containment check fires before any filesystem write for that entry.
    The containment check is performed against ``pkg_root`` (the top-level
    package directory passed to ``_copy_local_package``) so that symlinks
    that cross sub-directory boundaries but remain inside the package are
    accepted, while any symlink that escapes the package boundary is rejected
    with a hard failure.

    The ``_visited`` set tracks resolved directory paths already entered.
    Circular directory-symlink chains (A -> B -> A) are detected deterministically
    without relying on the OS ELOOP limit (which is platform-dependent).

    A directory that cannot be listed (e.g. ``PermissionError`` from
    ``iterdir``) hard-fails the install with a :class:`PathTraversalError`
    rather than leaking a bare ``OSError`` up the install stack.

    Args:

            with ``project_root`` -- the anchoring base and the security
            containment boundary are deliberately distinct concerns.
        project_root: Project root, threaded through for symmetry with the
            anchoring story but NOT used as a hard containment boundary
            here. The actual untrusted-source boundary lives upstream in
            :mod:`apm_cli.deps.apm_resolver` (remote-parent local paths are
            expanded to same-repo virtual deps or rejected before this
            function ever runs). Enforcing project-root containment
            *here* would also block legitimate sibling layouts -- e.g.
            ``apm install ../pkg-a`` from a monorepo workspace -- which
            users explicitly opt into. Kept on the signature so callers
            keep the security model in mind and so a future tightening
            (e.g. opt-in strict mode) has a hook.
        logger: Required CommandLogger for structured output. Callers must
            thread one in; we no longer fall back to a bare console helper
            (#940 SR4) because doing so masked logger threading bugs in
            transitive call stacks.

    Returns:
        install_path on success, None on failure.

    Notes:
        We deliberately do NOT call ``validate_path_segments`` on
        ``dep_ref.local_path``: that helper rejects ``..`` segments, which
        would break the legitimate ``../sibling`` pattern this PR enables.
        The untrusted-source boundary is the resolver-level expansion or
        rejection of remote-parent local_paths; everything reaching this
        function comes from a parent the user already trusts (their own
        manifest, a CLI arg, or another local package they explicitly added).
