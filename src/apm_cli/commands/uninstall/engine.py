       dependency's unique key as the canonical identity.  If an entry for the

       from the marketplace registry.  Skipped when *dry_run* is ``True``.
       A supply-chain guard refuses any canonical that is not already present
       in the lockfile (prevents a poisoned registry from removing an unrelated
       installed package).  Network errors fail only the affected package;

    3. **Unresolvable**: an error is logged with marketplace-specific wording
